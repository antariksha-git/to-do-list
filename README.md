This project is to-do list. Technologies used in developing this are JSP, Servlet, MySQL, JDBC.
Firstly, you are landed in index.html page as soon as you open it.
You are given the option of adding something to your to-do list. Also there's an option of viewing the current(or already added) list.

That's the simple project.
Took me 30 min to write and test it.
Thank you.
